# Creative Ideation

### About
*Creative Ideation* was developed and submitted as a degree capstone for Sheridan College's Honours Bachelor of Computer Science (Mobile Computing) program. 

This project aims to solve the problem of creative roadblocks in group ideation. *Creative Ideation* is an iOS (iPad) application that helps groups of users generate creative ideas with the help of AI assistance and guided game-like activities (E.g., arranging sticky notes, idea voting). This project was inspired by Creative Problem Solving (CPS) principles, which have been explored via personal study and learned through Sheridan Collegeâ€™s Certificate in Creativity and Creative Problem-Solving courses. This project aims to emulate the experience of table-top ideation by providing an online, mobile workspace that replaces the need for considerable desk space and automates much of what would normally be manual physical effort.
